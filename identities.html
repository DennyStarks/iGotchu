<p>Terms are always changing in the LGBTQIA+ community. This list will be updated as often as possible to keep up with the rapid changing queer and trans language. *Note: These are umbrella terms and not exact definitions. It depends on the person and how they identify themselves*</p>

<div class="container-mix">
  <div class="mix green">
  <dl>
    <dt>AFAB and AMAB:</dt> <dd>Acronyms meaning &quot;assigned female/male at birth&quot; (also designated female/male at birth or female/male assigned at birth).</dd>
    <dt>Ally/advocate:</dt> <dd>A person who confronts oppression/oppressive behaviors against marginalized groups the person isn’t in.</dd>
    <dt>Bottom Surgery:</dt> <dd>Genital surgeries such as vaginoplasty, phalloplasty, or metoidioplasty.</dd>
    <dt>Cisgender/cis:</dt> <dd> Term for someone who exclusively identifies as their sex assigned at birth. The term cisgender is not indicative of gender expression, sexual orientation, hormonal makeup, physical anatomy, or how one is perceived in daily life.</dd>
    <dt>Coming Out:</dt> <dd>Acknowledgment of one’s orientation and identity. Someone discloses their identity in varies ways, such as, verbally.</dd>
    <dt>Drag:</dt> <dd>Exaggerated, theatrical, and/or performative gender presentation. Although most commonly used to refer to cross-dressing performers (drag queens and drag kings), anyone of any gender can do any form of drag. Doing drag does not necessarily have anything to do with one’s sex assigned at birth, gender identity, or sexual orientation.</dd>
    <dt>LGBTQQIAPP+:</dt> <dd>A collection of identities short for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, aromantic, pansexual, polysexual (sometimes abbreviated to LGBT or LGBTQ+). Sometimes this acronym is replaced with &quot;queer.&quot; Note that &quot;ally&quot; is not included in this acronym.</dd>
    <dt>Micro-aggressions:</dt> <dd>The everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.</dd>
    <dt>Oppression:</dt> <dd>Systemic enforcement to prevent specific groups of people to have equal opportunities.</dd>
    <dt>Packing:</dt> <dd>Wearing a penile prosthesis.</dd>
    <dt>Passing/blending/assimilating:</dt> <dd>Being perceived by others as a particular identity/gender or cisgender regardless how the individual in question identifies, e.g. passing as straight, passing as a cis woman, passing as a youth. This term has become controversial as &quot;passing&quot; can imply that one is not genuinely what they are passing as.</dd>
    <dt>Queer:</dt><dd> A term for people of marginalized gender identities and sexual orientations who are not cisgender and/or heterosexual. This term has a complicated history as a reclaimed slur.</dd>
    <dt>Questioning:</dt> <dd>Analyzing/exploring oneself to figure out their gender/orientation.</dd>
    <dt>Sex binary:</dt> <dd>The social reinforcement that there are only two acceptable sexes → Female and Male.</dd>
    <dt>Sex:</dt> <dd>Socially constructed categories of people defined by common groupings of various biological distinctions (hormones, genitals, body hair, voice range, etc.)</dd>
    <dt>Stealth:</dt> <dd>To not be openly transgender in all or almost all social situations.</dd>
    <dt>T:</dt> <dd>Short for testosterone.</dd>
    <dt>Top Surgery:</dt> <dd>Chest surgery such as double mastectomy, breast augmentation, or periareolar (keyhole) surgeries.</dd>
    <dt>Transgender/Trans:</dt> <dd> Transgender: Umbrella term for gender identities differs from the gender they were assigned at birth. Ex: Trans women, trans men, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, bigender, etc. The term transgender is not indicative of gender expression, sexual orientation, hormonal makeup, physical anatomy, or how one is perceived in daily life.</dd>
    <dt>Transition:</dt> <dd>A person’s process of developing and assuming a gender expression to match their gender identity. Transition can include: coming out to one’s family, friends, and/or co-workers; changing one’s name and/or sex on legal documents; hormone therapy; and possibly (though not always) some form of surgery. It’s best not to assume how one transitions as it is different for everyone.</dd>
    <dt>Transmisogyny:</dt> <dd>Originally coined by the author Julia Serano, this term designates the intersections of transphobia and misogyny and how they are often experienced as a form of oppression by trans women.</dd>
    <dt>Transsexual:</dt> <dd>A deprecated term that is often considered pejorative similar to transgender in that it indicates a difference between one’s gender identity and sex assigned at birth. Transsexual often – though not always – implicates hormonal/surgical transition from one binary gender (male or female) to the other. Unlike transgender/trans, transsexual is not an umbrella term, as many transgender people do not identify as transsexual. When speaking/writing about trans people, please avoid the word transsexual unless asked to use it by a transsexual person.</dd>

<div class="mix blue">
  <dl>
    <dt>Agender:</dt> <dd>An umbrella term encompassing many different genders of people who commonly do not have a gender and/or have a gender that they describe as neutral. Many agender people are trans. As a new and quickly-evolving term, it is best you ask how someone defines agender for themselves.</dd>
    <dt>Bigender:</dt> <dd>Refers to those who identify as two genders. Can also identify as multigender (identifying as two or more genders).</dd>
    <dt>Butch:</dt> <dd>An identity or presentation that leans towards masculinity. Butch can be an adjective (she’s a butch woman), a verb (he went home to “butch up”), or a noun (they identify as a butch). Although commonly associated with masculine queer/lesbian women, it’s used by many to describe a distinct gender identity and/or expression and does not necessarily imply that one also identifies as a woman or not.</dd>
    <dt>Cissexism:</dt> <dd>Cissexism is a form of sexism, specifically, a way of thought in which only cisgender people are seen as normal or right.</dd>
    <dt>Cross-dressing (also crossdressing):</dt> <dd>The act of dressing and presenting as a different gender. One who considers this an integral part of their identity may identify as a cross-dresser. &quot;Transvestite&quot; is often considered a pejorative term with the same meaning. Drag performers are cross-dressing performers who take on stylized, exaggerated gender presentations (although not all drag performers identify as cross-dressers). Cross-dressing and drag are forms of gender expression and are not necessarily tied to erotic activity, nor are they indicative of one’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Do NOT use these terms to describe someone who has transitioned or intends to do so in the future.</dd>
    <dt>Demigirl/Demiboy:</dt> <dd>Identifying as partially, but not wholly, a woman/man, whatever their assigned gender at birth.</dd>
    <dt>Femme:</dt> <dd>An identity or presentation that leans towards femininity. Femme can be an adjective (he’s a femme boy), a verb (she feels better when she “femmes up”), or a noun (they’re a femme). Although commonly associated with feminine lesbian/queer women, it’s used by many to describe a distinct gender identity and/or expression, and does not necessarily imply that one also identifies as a woman or not.</dd>
    <dt>Gender Affirming Surgery; Genital Reassignment/Reconstruction Surgery; Vaginoplasty; Phalloplasty; Metoidioplasty:</dt> <dd>Refers to surgical alteration, and is only one part of some trans people’s transition (see “Transition” above). Only the minority of transgender people choose to and can afford to have genital surgery. The following terms are inaccurate, offensive, or outdated: sex change operation, gender reassignment/realignment surgery (gender is not changed due to surgery), gender confirmation/confirming surgery (genitalia do not confirm gender), and sex reassignment/realignment surgery (as it insinuates a single surgery is required to transition along with sex being an ambiguous term).</dd>
    <dt>Gender Dysphoria:</dt> <dd>Anxiety and/or discomfort regarding one’s sex assigned at birth.</dd>
    <dt>Gender Identity Disorder / GID:</dt> <dd>A controversial DSM-III and DSM-IV diagnosis given to transgender and other gender-nonconforming people. Because it labels people as “disordered,” Gender Identity Disorder is often considered offensive. The diagnosis is frequently given to children who don’t conform to expected gender norms in terms of dress, play or behavior. Such children are often subjected to intense psychotherapy, behavior modification and/or institutionalization. This term was replaced by the term &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; in the DSM-5.</dd>
    <dt>Gender Expression/Presentation:</dt> <dd>The physical manifestation of one’s gender identity through clothing, hairstyle, voice, body shape, etc. (typically referred to as masculine or feminine). Many transgender people seek to make their gender expression (how they look) match their gender identity (who they are), rather than their sex assigned at birth. Someone with a gender nonconforming gender expression may or may not be transgender. *Some people don’t use clothing/body language/etc. to express gender.</dd>
    <dt>Gender identity:</dt> <dd>How a person identifies their own gender.</dd>
    <dt>Gender non-conforming/Genderqueer/Nonbinary:</dt> <dd>Gender expression or identity that is outside/beyond a specific culture/society’s gender expectations, could be used as an umbrella term for those who don’t identify either female or male.</dd>
    <dt>Gender:</dt> <dd>A social combination of identity, expression, and social elements in relation to masculinity and femininity. Potentially includes social gender (social expectations), gender roles (socialized actions), and gender attribution (social perception).</dd>
    <dt>Genderfluid:</dt> <dd>Refers to those who Identify with different genders depending on how they feel &quot;Fluid.&quot;</dd>
    <dt>Heteronormativity:</dt> <dd>Belief that people fall into distinct and complementary genders (man and woman) with natural roles in life.</dd>
    <dt>Heterosexism:</dt> <dd>A system of attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships More Terminology.</dd>
    <dt>Intersex:</dt> <dd>Umbrella term for a variety of biological conditions in which a person is born with sex characteristics that do not conform to socially constructed categories of anatomical sex, h*rm*phr*d*te is a slur.</dd>
    <dt>Monosexual / Multisexual / Non-monosexual:</dt> <dd>Umbrella terms for orientations directed towards one gender (monosexual) or multiple genders (multisexual/non-monosexual).</dd>
    <dt>Nonbinary (Also Non-Binary):</dt> <dd>Preferred umbrella term for all genders other than female/male or woman/man, used as an adjective (e.g. Jesse is a nonbinary person). Not all nonbinary people identify as trans and not all trans people identify as nonbinary. Sometimes (and increasingly), nonbinary can be used to describe the aesthetic/presentation/expression of a cisgender or transgender person.</dd>
    <dt>Sex Assigned at Birth:</dt> <dd>The assignment and classification of people as male, female, intersex, or another sex assigned at birth often based on physical anatomy at birth.</dd>
    <dt>Transgender/Trans:</dt> <dd> Umbrella term for gender identities differs from the gender they were assigned at birth. Ex: Trans women, trans men, genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, bigender, etc. The term transgender is not indicative of gender expression, sexual orientation, hormonal makeup, physical anatomy, or how one is perceived in daily life.</dd>
    <dt>Trans Woman / Trans Man:</dt> <dd>Trans woman generally describes someone assigned male at birth who identifies as a woman. This individual may or may not actively identify as trans. Many trans individuals prefer a space between trans and woman/man. Other do not. Often it is good just to use woman or man. Sometimes trans women identify as male-to-female (also MTF, M2F, or trans feminine) and sometimes trans men identify as female-to-male (also FTM, F2M, or trans masculine). Please ask before identifying someone. Use the term and pronouns preferred by the individual.</dd>
    <dt>Two Spirit:</dt> <dd>An umbrella term indexing various indigenous gender identities in North America.</dd>

For example, a trans woman who is exclusively attracted to other women would often identify as lesbian.</dd>
